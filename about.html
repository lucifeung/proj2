    Since I was little, I have always been into different types of art like drawing, painting, sewing, making poems, playing with clay, etc. Despite that, it took me a very long time to persuade my parents to let me try following the type of career that I love, and not what they want or what they think is "best for me". Now that I was finally able to choose to go on the path I desire, I am trying my best to learn more about art, especially digital art, in order to achieve my dream. Although my works are a bit clumsy comparing to other professional artists, I am still trying to learn more each day, and I hope that someday in the future, I will be able to look back and realize how much I've grown.
